2015-11-14-SM: Coming along slowly. I'm trying to figure out how to set up the
               relationship for the panes and components. I meant for the
               GameBoard to be a graphic class and it has become a pane. I
               think a BoardPane to hold the graphics would be more suitable
               for this abstraction.

               I'm thinking GameBoard will remain an abstract graphics class,
               MancalaBoard will be the implementation of that and the pits
               will be layered on top of the board and will provide the
               event handling. There is a layeredpane class that might help
               with this but I'm not sure if that is necessary.

2015-11-14-SM: Not happy about instructor guidelines about package setup.
               It is going to make this project more difficult to maintain
               and just is bad practice all around.

               I'm going to be spending the next two days working on this.
               Will outline the overall work here.
