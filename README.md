# Mancala
Group project for SJSU CS151 (Object-Oriented Design). As a group of three a 
graphical version of Mancala will be implemented in Java code using 
predetermined design patterns.

* Don't use packages. "Because I said so." - Dr. Kim
  J/k, I don't know why she doesn't want us to use them. Oh well.
  Just don't use them I guess. Leave it messy.

* Please make sure you adhere to the SJSU code Styleguide. I have
  included a settings.jar file in the main project directory which I believe
  you can simply import into your own project. It should give you the proper
  indentation and brace positioning.
  
  Otherwise read the STYLEGUIDE doc in the project directory and go into
  File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Java and  make the appropriate
  changes yourself.
